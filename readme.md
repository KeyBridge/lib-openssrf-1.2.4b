# OpenSSRF Reference Implementation Software
## V3.1.0rc1 (Release Candidate)

OpenSSRF is an open source reference implementation of the Standard Spectrum Resource 
Format (SSRF). The specification is defined in MCEB Pub 8. 
The latest version of this software implements Version 3.1.0 as of 2014-09-16 (with corrections).
Previous versions implemented Version 3.0 as of 2012-04-26. Visit [OpenSSRF.org](http://openssrf.org)
to download previous distributions.

The goal of this project is to develop and publish a complete and certifiably 
compliant reference implementation of the Standard Spectrum Resource Format (version 3.x) into Java.

See the [tutorial](tutorial.md) for a brief how-to.

## In this Release
The software contained in this release is, to the best of our knowledge, a complete
and compliant implementation of the SSRF v3.1.0 data format specification. 

Special attention and effort has been invested to organize the software, to improve the approachability of the
underlying SSRF logical data model, and to add methods and techniques to simplify 
the construction of SSRF data structures.

### Useful features in OpenSSRF:

 * Data type validation: A comprehensive data type validation strategy has been incorporated into the software to implement and enforce the SSRF data format and validation rules.
 * Pick lists: Support for pick lists has been updated to match both the schema and text of the specification.
 * Software packaging: SSRF data types are organized naturally according to their use and parent-child relationship with other data types.
 * Software abstraction and simplification: Metadata and other common elements and data attributes have been consolidated into several abstract classes and types.
 * Developer utilities: Methods supporting the fluent programming interface have been introduced throughout the new software library.

### New features in this release:
 * A sophisticated set of utilities for automated XML reading, writing, assmbly and validation 
 * Content validation: Required attributes and elements are validated.
 * Patterned fields: Formatted string patterned fields are programmatically generated. Direct user input is not required. 
 * Indexed cross-referencing: SSRF cross referencing between data element is fully automatic.
 * Metadata configuration: Metadata fields are automatically configured using a powerful SSRF properties configuration utility.

Not in this Release (TODO List)
 * External references: SSRF supports the incorporation of external references by file or URI. This is out of scope and left to the application developer.

## SSRF Background

SSRF is based on the NATO Spectrum Management Allied Data Exchange Format-eXtensible Markup Language
(SMADEF-XML) data standard. NTIAâ€™s Office of Spectrum Management Data Dictionary (OSMDD) is expected to
also be compatible with SSRF and SMADEF-XML. 

Standard Spectrum Resource Format (SSRF)-compliant systems are able to exchange spectrum data with the
National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO), and with Combined Communications-Electronics Board (CCEB) nations.

Standard Spectrum Resource Format (SSRF) was originally a format for exchanging data related to spectrum
management within the United States Department of Defense (DOD). Within this context, SSRF-compliant 
systems are able to exchange electromagnetic spectrum data with the National Telecommunications and Information
Administration (NTIA), the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and with Combined
Communications-Electronics Board (CCEB) nations.

## Background of this Project

In 2013 Key Bridge approached officials at the DoD to use SSRF on a license-free, commercial basis and,
upon receiving positive response, collaborated with the Wireless Innovation Forum to initiate 
a joint Government-Industry work group to develop and publish an open source, license-free reference 
implementation of the most recent SSRF specification. 

This project is managed by the Open Standard Spectrum Resource Format (SSRF) group and organized
by the Wireless Innovation Forum's [Spectrum Innovation Committee](http://groups.winnforum.org/spectrum_innovation_committee).

## Availability and Use

The source code and documentation within this project are available under the Apache 2.0 license, copies of which are
included in the source tree and documentation directories.

You are free to download, use and modify this project without restriction, subject to the terms of the Apache 2.0 license.

## Give Back

Your code and contributions are welcome. There are two ways you can give back and help improve and perfect this reference implementation.

 1. Join the Wireless Innovation Forum. By joining the Forum you gain formal and informal access to a large community of like-minded companies, government agencies and individuals working together for a common goal. Forum members may also participate in the architecture committee of this software project and also influence future development and improvement of the SSRF specification.
 2. Contribute software. Anyone can fork the code and submit your updates, fixes, utilities and other contributions directly to Key Bridge. We will review and incorporate anything that is helpful.
